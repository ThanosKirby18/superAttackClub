Advanced Java Topics

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use RegEx and how to implement it into a project. We learned how test instances of regex with conditionals
and with JUnit testing

I worked on this assignment mostly by myself. However I had recieved help from fellow classmentes Sofia and Steve.
